# DataAlgorithms-Review
This repository is your go-to resource for revisiting data structures and algorithms in C. Inside, you'll find a collection of code snippets, exercises, and projects aimed at reinforcing your understanding of these fundamental concepts.

# STEPS
state the problem clearly
come up with input and output examples that cover edge cases
come up with a solution for the problem
implement the solution and test using example inputs
analyse the time complexity
apply the right techniques to fix inefficiencies
